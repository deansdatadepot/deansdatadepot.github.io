# Welcome to the Dean's Data Depot!
Hello all and welcome to the Dean's Data Depot. My name is Geoffrey Dean and today is December 21, 2021. Today I will be discussing the Dean's Data Depot and why you should come here for your sports analytics content! Started in January 2021 while a freshman in college, I  combined my love of predictive modeling and sports to start building my first models that I then presented on MUTV, the University of Missouri's student TV station. This soon grew into a full fledged show, a Twitter account, and a podcast all bringing regular sports analytics content to the people. Now, it will take to the internet in a blog form, with article breaking down the sports world with data. I hope you enjoy the content, and if so, go ahead and follow the blog on Twitter @DeanDataDepot!
