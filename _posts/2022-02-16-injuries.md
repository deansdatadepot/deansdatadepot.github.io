# Do Turf Fields Really Lead to More Injuries?
As Los Angeles Rams emerged triumphant over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI, 
they did lose a pivotal member of their Super Bowl squad. Superstar wideout Odell Beckham Jr., a midseason acquisition for the Rams, 
went down with an injury midway through the second quarter. This sparked conversation about the possible safety risks that turf fields pose to players. 
  
During the 2021-22 NFL season, more than 50 players appeared on the NFL's injury report with specifically cited ACL or MCL tears, and in a few cases injuries to both ligaments. Some of these
injuries occurred during practice, on indeterminable surfaces. Of the injuries that took place during games, both regular and preseason, 54% took place on turf fields.
Of the 27 in-game injuries, 41% happened at either SoFi Stadium, like Beckham Jr.'s injury, home of the Rams, Chargers, and Super Bowl LVI,
or at Metlife Stadium, home of the New York Jets and Giants.
